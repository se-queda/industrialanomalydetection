# Industrial Anomaly Detection Colab Notebook

This notebook provides an end-to-end implementation for training an industrial anomaly detection model on Google Colab.

## Environment Setup

```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install -q some-library
```

## Data Preparation

```python
# Load and prepare data
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_data.csv')

# Data preprocessing steps
```

## Training

```python
# Define model
from some_model import Model

model = Model()

# Train model
model.train(df)
```

## Evaluation

```python
# Evaluate model performance
results = model.evaluate()
print(results)
```
