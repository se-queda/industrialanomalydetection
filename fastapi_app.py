"""
FastAPI microservice for ReConPatch inference.

This service loads a trained student model and FAISS memory bank index
produced by the ReConPatch training pipeline and exposes an HTTP API
for anomaly inspection.  Clients can POST an image file to the `/infer`
endpoint and receive a JSON response containing the anomaly score,
binary prediction and a path to the generated heatmap.  The model
architecture and inference logic are kept faithful to the ReConPatch
paper; only the surrounding FastAPI plumbing and error handling have
been added.

To run this service in development:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn fastapi_app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Place your trained assets (`student_model.h5` and `memory_bank.index`)
inside a directory called `production_assets` at the same level as this
script.  If the assets are missing, the service will still start but
will return a placeholder response until the files are supplied.
